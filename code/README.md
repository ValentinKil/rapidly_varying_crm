This repository contains the complete codebase used for the experiments. The code is organized as follows:

- **display**: Contains utility functions for visualizing results.
- **inference**: Implements the MCMC inference algorithm described in the article.
- **models**: Includes the implementation of the proposed models.
- **sampling**: Provides sampling methods for both the CRM and the network.
- **utils**: Offers various utility functions.

Additionally, we provide notebooks with minimal examples demonstrating how to use the code.
